customer not getting order acknowledgements automatically	"

received from: ourhmqta.tjwnqexo@gmail.com

two customer accounts have not been getting the order acknowledgements automatically like they have been for the past 10 years. both are under the same top parent

accts 81184926657 and 81862217657 should automatically be sending acknowledgements to   hdyrugdty@gmail.com

since october 14'th they have not been getting them.

can someone look into this?  this is affecting the customer paying the bills, as they use this acknowledgement as a receiver so they can pay the bill.

hello,_x000D_

in the recent past, we are facing an issue of pricing condition not getting changed while booking the order._x000D_
_x000D_
though we override the pricing condition with znr, the pricing condition remains as zlp1 only._x000D_

for example, in oa 36131265, the price was over written with znr condition with a nett price of rs. 5726.54.  but still pricing condition is shown as zlp1 with standard discount._x000D_
_x000D_
what we have observed is whenever there are sub delivery items created due to non-availability of stock, this issue crops up.  that too, after the challan is created, it becomes too difficult to make any changes._x000D_
